## IoT-kaasumittari 

Gauge
### Sensor and backend
- Hardware: MQ-2 Gas sensor, Raspberry Pi 3+, and ADC Pi Plus
- Software: Raspbian GNU/Linux 9, Python, pymongo, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, JavaScript backend and REST webservice (to get data from Raspberry via wlan) 

### Frontend and Displays for browsers 
- Hardware: Laptops
- Software: 
  - Windows 10 and GNU/Linux
  - Node.js, ReactJS, axios, react-chartjs-2, moment, python, JavaScript   


### ToDo
- do real gas measurements to see what we can measure with MQ-2 Gas sensor and after this "lock" the features 
- calibration: only draft calibration, we don't need accurate values
- add temperature sensor to Raspberry 
- sensor data to MongoDB via REST (just training)
- use of MQTT for the sensor data 
- if time: put front end also to Raspberry Pi and measure use of Pi's cpu usage  


### Done: 
- 1st measurement with this full-stack system, see raspberry_eka_savu.jpg (used pymongo)
- learned to use GitHub with the team: kit, Aapo, and Lassi 
- 1st 'front end' and 'back end' are here
